title: "Applications of First Principles"
---

We often overlook first principles due to their self-evident nature, as our focus lies in uncovering less apparent truths. In mathematical contexts, while clear first principles, such as the definition of differentiation, exist, their direct application may not lead us far in practical derivations. Instead, we leverage a multitude of clever methods devised by brilliant minds over centuries, allowing us to work efficiently without constant contemplation of the foundational principles.

Applying first principles without considering their broader consequences can be a perilous mindset, exemplified by the notion "you only live once." While it urges us to seek meaningful and joyful experiences, its straightforward application could lead to a myopic pursuit of pleasure without productivity. However, it’s important to realise that it’s better to be productive to maximise happiness in the long term rather than in the short term, so it becomes the intermediate trick we use and we temporarily forget about the ultimate goal to focus all our attention on practical methods.

This perspective underscores the complexity hidden beneath the surface of first principles. Institutions often have primary goals akin to first principles, guiding their actions and influencing intermediate objectives. Despite a cynical interpretation of a government's primary goal as resource extraction from citizens and land, intermediate goals like building infrastructure contribute positively to public welfare. Similarly, while private companies' primary goal may be profit maximization, their intermediate goals of delivering quality products and services benefit consumers.

In essence, understanding and navigating first principles involves appreciating the intricate layers of consequences and adopting pragmatic strategies that align with both short-term and long-term objectives.
